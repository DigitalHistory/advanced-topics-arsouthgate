# Project Proposal

## Introduction

Canada is at a disadvantage in terms of having open-access archives documenting our foreign policy history. There are certainly some digital archives committed to Canadian history, most notably Library and Archives Canada. [^1] (http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/Pages/home.aspx), and the CBC Digital Archives (http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/war-conflict/cold-war/), but nothing akin to the Wilson Centre International Cold War History Project (CWIHP) (https://www.wilsoncenter.org/program/cold-war-international-history-project) or the George Washington University’s National Security Archive (NSA) (https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/). It is the NSA that is of particular interest to this project and acts as an intellectual model for what a Canadian National Security Archive (CNSA) could be. The NSA mission statement articulates a unique archival framework: “investigative journalism center, research institute on international affairs, library and archive of declassified U.S. documents, leading non-profit user of the U.S. Freedom of Information Act, public interest law firm defending and expanding public access to government information, global advocate of open government, and indexer and publisher of former secrets.” (https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/about). The NSA has been in operation since 1985 and has established a broad network of projects, so it is not a direct analogue to the proposed fledgling CNSA but it is worthwhile to understand existing archives and imagine where the CNSA could go, given enough time.

The CNSA will focus on the library/archive aspect and seek to create an archive of documents that give a picture of Canadian national security as well as a historiography of relevant research. It is not that Canadian history is boring, or that there is a lack of relevant research, but rather there is no easily-accessible archive to collect this information and disseminate it to the public. We would like this archive to be more than a “dumping ground” for documents, and follow the lead of the NSA and the CWIHP and be a learning hub for research and education. This would include multimedia “briefing books” that provide interested researchers with a quick look at batches of documents that are related to one another. Primary sources can be difficult to work with and the proposed briefing books would be an excellent tool for facilitating the work of researchers and the interest of the general public.

It is with this in mind that we are applying for the Small Team Grant from the Hacking History Foundation. A small team of historians will work for two years to create the archive and make it operational. We will draw as much as possible from existing research with the goal of setting up an academic hub for the general public. We believe that after the grant is final we will be able to continue the work through other grants/donations but at the very least we want to have a functional and informative website at the end of the two years.



##Methods

As we mentioned in our introduction, our historians will draw mainly from existing research. Although we are planning for the archive to be a research centre employing our own historians we understand that initial goal must be to generate a useable research “hub.” We will seek researchers who are working in the field of Canadian foreign policy through general ads at major universities, while also working on establishing our reputation. An example of the researchers we will contact are the researchers involved with the Canadian Foreign Intelligence History Project (CFIHP)
(https://carleton.ca/csids/canadian-foreign-intelligence-history-project/) hosted by Carleton University. Through Access To Information Requests (ATI) the researchers at the CFIHP have unearthed many of documents relating to Canadian foreign intelligence from the such sources as the Department of National Defence, the Department of External Affairs, the Privy Council Office, and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service. These documents are only available to CFIHP partners; however, which renders the collection virtually inaccessible to the general public. Our proposed archive would be broadly accessible and—unlike the CFIHP—would not limit access to university students and faculty, or people with connections to a CFIHP partner.

While our historians are collecting the documents, which will also likely include ATI requests of our own, we will also work to facilitate the technological aspects of the archives. Following the lead of our model archives—the NSA and the CFIHP— we have partnered with the University of Toronto to host this project. The reality is that the quantity of data being stored by projects on this scale are very difficult for independent researchers to handle and we require the data management capabilities of the U of T library system. This includes access to the Omeka system, which has been described as the “Wordpress for exhibits and collections” (http://mars.gmu.edu/bitstream/handle/1920/6089/2008-02-20_IntroOmeka.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y). Omeka’s interface is relatively simple for our researchers to use and is already integrated into the U of T system which means that we can access the assistance and troubleshooting expertise of U of T librarians and technicians. This also means that we already have a model for how the archive will be exhibited on the U of T library website (https://exhibits.library.utoronto.ca/). Ideally we will eventually have our own webpage on the U of T website, but that will only be possible once we have the content and reputation to justify it. As this is a fledgling project, we need to be aware of our current capabilities so as to not overstretch ourselves. We would also like to have metadata describing key components of our content, for the use of future researchers and for statistical purposes. To this end, all of the documents we accumulate will also be entered into a spreadsheet so that we can keep track of document provenance, classification status, content tags, and similar information. This will be a relatively simple process but every keystroke takes a certain amount of time that we will have to budget for and try to streamline. 	

##Timeline

We anticipate using the full two years for this project, in part because we do not know how many researchers we will successfully recruit to the team. If we exceed our conservative estimates, we will be able to do more of our own research and ATI requests. Because we want this archive to be as fully stocked as possible, the required quantity of documents and briefing books is substantial. We estimate that it will take about two months to locate documents and write briefing books, so if we assume three researchers, we should generate 36 briefing books within two years. This is a rough estimate and it is likely that some documents will take much longer to find and analyze. We fully understand the difficulties inherent in archival research particularly when done in collaboration with academics at other institutions. Because this work can be done even before the Omeka exhibit is up and running, our researchers could start immediately.

We anticipate the technological aspects to be online fairly quickly because we will use existing software. We expect that our researchers will have an understanding of the Omeka software within six months and have a system in place for the metadata spreadsheet. We would ideally have at least one team member devoted solely to the technical aspects, especially considering that we are aware that some scholars find Omeka challenging to use. We expect our technical expert to assist the researchers with Omeka and look for ways to make it more straightforward. We expect to create a functional exhibit within the first year, and will use the second year to find content, troubleshoot, and refine the exhibit presentation. Our timeline is flexible for now, as we will need a full team meeting to identify our available skills and abilities, and while we do not want to rush our researchers, we understand the necessity of deadlines.

##Importance

In 1995, the famed deconstructionist philosopher Jacques Derrida theorized the importance of the archive in his article Archive Fever: A Freudian Impression. Derrida states that “perhaps . . . the question of the archive is not, we repeat, a question of the past. This is not the question of a concept dealing with the past which might already be at our disposal or not at our disposal, an archivable concept of the archive. It is a question of the future, the question of the future itself, the question of a response, of a promise and of a responsibility for tomorrow” (http://artsites.ucsc.edu/sdaniel/230/derrida_archivefever.pdf 27). It is precisely this “responsibility for tomorrow” that draws us to archives, because remembering and recording history can be a political act. Just as the NSA considers itself, at least in part, to be a centre for investigative journalist, the proposed CNSA will ignite an interest in Canada’s involvement (or lack thereof) in major historical events and conflicts. When history students take Cold War history classes their research essays are almost entirely based on the American or British points of view, because they have much better and more-accessible archives than Canada. This must change, because as a Canadian university we should focus at least somewhat on Canada’s foreign policy positions, even if this focus shows that Canada had little influence on NATO during the Cold War. We have a responsibility to future students to ensure they have access to a wide range of research and educational possibilities. Canada is a democracy and we must be watchful and critical of the various institutions that govern us. We may unearth documents as part of this process that are controversial or shed light on problematic Government stances, and it is our responsibility to make them accessible to the Canadian public. We believe this to be an integral part of the historical process, and digital history is unique in its ability to widely disseminate information.

Although it is easy to widely disseminate information in the digital age, it continues to be important to think about how we do so. As William G. Thomas muses in “Interchange: The Promise of Digital History,” digital historians are asking themselves: “Where does interpretation go in these online projects?” (457). This interpretational aspect—analyzing and narrating the past—has always been an important aspect of the historian’s work. A recurring topic within historian circles is that this aspect will be lost with the advent of digital history. We believe that interpretation is still relevant and important which is why we propose to create our briefing books. In answer to Thomas’s question, interpretation continues to be important and can be integrated into digital history projects. Archives are useful and powerful tools and should not be entombed in inaccessible institutional catacombs. Digital history is more powerful and useful if it is public and accessible.
