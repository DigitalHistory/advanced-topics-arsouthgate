# Where is Vinland?
Vinland, or “Wineland,” is the name for a location with a prominent place in the Viking sagas. It has long been thought to be the VIking name for North America, but until 1960 there was no archeological proof. This all changed with the discovery of L’anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland, while also prompting speculation about locations such as Helluland and Markland which were previously thought to be purely fictional. In 2015 another settlement was found in Newfoundland, which has allowed archaeologists to further argue that Vinland is indeed located on the east coast of North America. This webpage will combine archeological findings with close readings of the Viking texts known as the Vinland Sagas in order to pinpoint some of these locations.

# The Vinland Sagas

The Vinland Sagas are divided into two texts, Eirik the Red’s Saga and The Saga of the Greenlanders, which chronicle the expeditions of Leif Erikson and Thorfinn Karlsefni as the venture west. Like most Viking texts, the sagas have a roundabout approach to storytelling and actually begin with the story of Leif Eriksson’s father, Eirik Thorvaldsson, banishment to Greenland.[^1] Known as Eirik the Red, he traveled throughout Greenland establishing settlements and naming landmarks, eventually settling in Brattahlíð.[^2] There is clear archeological evidence that Vikings did indeed establish Greenland, and it’s close proximity to North America alone makes it possible that they ventured even further west.

According to Eirik the Red’s Saga it was on a voyage to Greenland from Norway that Leif Eriksson was swept off course and “lighted upon lands of which before he had no expectation” finding wheat, vine-trees, and maples.[^3] There is some dissonance between Eirik the Red’s Saga and The Saga of the Greenlanders in regards to the details of some of the voyages, but the two texts make it clear that following this initial discovery there were many more expeditions to North America, including failed attempts to settle. The descriptions of the resources available such as whales, game, and grapes as well as the topographical descriptions give credence to the idea that Vinland is in North America.[^4] Other areas described in the sagas seem to describe Baffin Island and Labrador, respectively.  

It is actually the failed attempts at settlement described in the sagas that further make the case for Vinlands location because one of the key reasons that the Vikings didn’t stay is due to conflict with Indigenous populations. There is, again, some discrepancy about this in the sagas but it is definitely clear that the explorers encountered Indigenous populations. The Saga of the Greenlanders implies that the expedition fights with the indigenous peoples but then leaves for unrelated reasons[^5], while Eirik the Red’s states that “. . . despite everything the land had to offer there, they would be under constant threat of attack from its prior inhabitants.”[^6]

# Archaeological Evidence
Although the saga’s are a valuable source in understanding Viking culture and are good place to start if you want to understand the phenomenon of Vinland, they are not enough to empirically prove that Vikings came to North America. For years the archeological evidence unavailable and Vinland was dismissed as a work of fiction, until Helge Ingstad and Anne Stine Ingstad discovered the Norse settlements of L’anse aux Meadows in 1960. Interestingly, the settlements in L’anse aux Meadows do not include any barns or evidence of livestock (which would imply that it intended as a long-term settlement). Instead, it is made up of dwellings and workshops that suggest that it was used as an access point to the St. Lawrence, a stop over in which to take a break and fix your ship before venturing further south.[^7]

L’anse aux Meadows actually corresponds with a location in the sagas, Leifsbúðir–Straumfjorðr, which has led to speculation about other locations. Helluland and Markland in particular are of interest, because their physical descriptions match almost perfectly with Baffin Island and Labrador. Helluland translates to “Land of Stone Slabs” and is described thusly: “great icebergs were over all up the country, but like a plain of flat stones was all from the sea to the mountains.”[^8] Markland, on the other hand, translates to “Forest Land” is described as “flat, and covered with wood, and white sands were far around where they went, and the shore was low.”[^9]

While we wait for further proof about these other locations, we can be comforted by the fact that more and more information is being discovered everyday. In 2015 Sarah Parcak, an archeologist working with National Geographic, led an excavation team to Point Rosee located on the southern tip of Newfoundland. There they found evidence of Viking structures and a hearth used for roasting iron ore.[^10] It has yet to be confirmed, but if Point Rosee proves to be real it only serves as more evidence in support of Vinland.

## Conclusion

Ultimately, the search for Vinland has allowed archaeologists to prove what historians have long believed; there is historical merit to the Viking sagas. Visualizing the close proximity of Greenland makes it easy to imagine that Vikings were able to come to North America, and the discovery of Viking settlements in Newfoundland allows us to envision exactly how far they ventured.
